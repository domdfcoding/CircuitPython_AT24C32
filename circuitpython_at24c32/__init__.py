	**Quickstart: Importing and using the device**

		Here is an example of using the :class:`AT24C32` class.
		First you will need to import the required libraries:

		.. code-block:: python

			import board
			import at24c32

		Once this is done you can define your `board.I2C` object and create an `AT24C32` instance:

		.. code-block:: python

			i2c = board.I2C()  # uses board.SCL and board.SDA
			eeprom = at24c32.AT24C32(i2c)

		.. TODO:: Read and write data

	:param ~busio.I2C i2c: The I2C bus the device is connected to

		* If ``val`` is an integer or a single byte, it is written to ``start_addr``.
		* If ``val`` is a :class:`bytearray` or a multi-byte string,
		  the bytes are written sequentially starting from ``start_addr``.
